Total population: Usually refers to the present-in-area (de facto) population which includes all persons physically present within the present geographical boundaries of countries at the mid-point of the reference period.
Unit: 1000 inhab

VarId: 4105
Rural population: Usually the rural population is obtained by subtracting the urban population from the total population. In practice, the criteria adopted for distinguishing between urban and rural areas vary among countries. However, these criteria can be roughly divided into three major groups: classification of localities of a certain size as urban; classification of administrative centres of minor civil divisions as urban; and classification of centres of minor civil divisions on a chosen criterion which may include type of local government, number of inhabitants or proportion of population engaged in agriculture. Thus, the urban and rural population estimates in this domain are based on the varying national definitions of urban areas.

VarId: 4106
Urban population: Population residing in urban areas. Usually the urban areas and hence the urban population are defined according to national census definitions which can be roughly divided into three major groups: classification of localities of a certain size as urban; classification of administrative centres of minor civil divisions as urban; and classification of centres of minor civil divisions on a chosen criterion which may include type of local government, number of inhabitants or proportion of population engaged in agriculture, as urban.

Human Development Index (HDI) [highest = 1]: This is a summary measure of human development. It measures the average achievements in a country in three basic dimensions of human development: (1) a long and healthy life, as measured by life expectancy at birth; (2) knowledge, as measured by the adult literacy rate (with two-thirds weight) and the combined primary, secondary and tertiary gross enrolment ratio (with one-third weight); (3) a decent standard of living, as measured by GDP per capita (Purchasing Power Parity or PPP US$).

VarId: 4537
Gender Inequality Index (GII) [equality = 0; inequality = 1): The Gender Inequality Index (GII) is built on the same framework as the Human Development Index (HDI) — to better expose differences in the distribution of achievements between women and men. It measures the human development costs of gender inequality, thus the higher the GII value the more disparities between females and males. The GII values vary tremendously across countries, they range from 0.021 to 0.733. Countries with high gender inequality also experience more unequal distribution of human development.

VarId: 4112
Gross Domestic Product (GDP): GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in current United States dollars (US$). Dollar figures for GDP are converted from domestic currencies using single year official exchange rates. For a few countries where the official exchange rate does not reflect the rate effectively applied to actual foreign exchange transactions, an alternative conversion factor is used.

Unit: current US$/inhab

VarId: 4113
Agriculture, value added (% GDP): Agriculture corresponds to ISIC divisions 1-5 and includes forestry, hunting, and fishing, as well as cultivation of crops and livestock production. Value added is the net output of a sector after adding up all outputs and subtracting intermediate inputs. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or depletion and degradation of natural resources. The origin of value added is determined by the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC), revision 3.  Note:  This value is not specific to crop production, so care should be taken to ensure proper implementation.

VarId: 4548
Agriculture, value added to GDP: Gross value added by agriculture (excluding river and marine fisheries and forestry), in ISIC rev. 4 “agriculture” corresponds to ISIC A (Divisions 01-03: crops and animal production, forestry, and fishing). For the purpose of SDG 6.4.1 in agriculture, fresh water fishing, marine fishing, and forestry should be excluded, but all nurseries and aquaculture are included. The Gross value added by agriculture (GVAa) is calculated by adding up all agricultural outputs and subtracting intermediate inputs; but without making deductions for depreciation of fixed assets or depletion and degradation of natural resources.

Number of people undernourished (3-year average): Number of people in a condition of undernourishment. The number of persons undernourished is obtained by multiplying estimates of the proportion of undernourished for each country (see term "Prevalence of undernourishment") by estimates of the total population. Undernourishment refers to the condition of people whose dietary energy consumption is continuously below a minimum dietary energy requirement for maintaining a healthy life and carrying out a light physical activity. The indicator is calculated on 3-year averages. Year shown in results page refers to last year of the 3-year period.
Unit: 1000 inhab

VarId: 4474
Prevalence of undernourishment (3-year average): This indicator expresses the probability that a randomly selected individual from the population consumes an amount of calories that is insufficient to cover her/his energy requirement for an active and healthy life. 
The indicator is computed by comparing a probability distribution of habitual daily Dietary Energy Consumption with a threshold level called the Minimum Dietary Energy Requirement. Both are based on the notion of an average individual in the reference population.  The indicator is calculated on 3-year averages. Year shown in the results page is the last year of the 3-year period.
This is the traditional FAO hunger indicator, adopted as official Millennium Development Goal indicator for Goal 1, Target 1.9.
More details on the methodology for computing the Prevalence of undernourishment are in Annex 2 of the State of Food Insecurity in the World 2013 Report (SOFI 2013). http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3434e/i3434e.pdf.

VarId: 4114
Total population with access to improved drinking-water source (JMP): Percentage of the total population using improved water sources. An “improved” source is one that is likely to provide "safe" water, such as a household connection, a borehole, etc. Current information does not allow yet to establish a relationship between access to safe water and access to improved sources, but WHO and UNICEF are examining this relationship.
Safe drinking water is water that contains no biological or chemical pathogen at a level of concentration that is directly harmful to health. This includes treated, untreated, uncontaminated surface water, such as protected boreholes, springs and sanitary wells. The waters of rivers and lakes can only be considered healthy if water quality is regularly monitored and considered acceptable by public health officials. Reasonable access to water means a water supply in the water. housing or within 15 minutes walk of it.

% of agricultural GVA produced by irrigated agriculture: Part of the gross value added by agriculture originating from the irrigated agriculture, as opposed to rainfed agriculture. In countries where rainfed agriculture dominates the agricultural sector, a large proportion of agricultural GVA in national accounts comes from values produced by rainfed agriculture. As the rainfed system does not entail direct water abstraction, the value added from this system needs to be deducted from the total agricultural GVA in order to obtain a realistic figure of WUE in agriculture.

Agricultural water withdrawal as % of total renewable water resources: Water withdrawn for irrigation in a given year, expressed in percent of the total renewable water resources (TRWR). This parameter is an indication of the pressure on the renewable water resources caused by irrigation.
Note: While freshwater withdrawal as % of total renewable water resources refers to withdrawal of surface water and groundwater, agricultural water withdrawal also includes non-conventional sources of water (such as direct use of wastewater and agricultural drainage water, desalinated water). That's why in some countries agricultural water withdrawal as % of total renewable water resources can be higher than freshwater withdrawal as % of total renewable water resources.
Calculation Criteria: [Agricultural water withdrawal as % of total renewable water resources] = 100*[Agricultural water withdrawal]/[Total renewable water resources]
Unit: %

VarId: 4250
Agricultural water withdrawal: Annual quantity of self-supplied water withdrawn for irrigation, livestock and aquaculture purposes. It can include water from renewable freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water. Water for the dairy and meat industries and industrial processing of harvested agricultural products is included under industrial water withdrawal.

VarId: 4260
Irrigation water requirement: The quantity of water exclusive of precipitation and soil moisture (i.e. quantity of irrigation water) required for normal crop production. It consists of water to ensure that the crop receives its full crop water requirement (i.e. irrigation consumptive water use, as well as extra water for flooding of paddy fields to facilitate land preparation and protect the plant and for leaching salt when necessary to allow for plant growth). It is usually expressed in water depth (millimetres) or water volume (m3) and may be stated in monthly, seasonal or annual terms, or for a crop period. It corresponds to net irrigation water requirement. More information can be found on http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/water_use/index.stm.
Unit: km^3/year or 10^9m^3/year

VarId: 4475
Irrigation water withdrawal: Annual quantity of water withdrawn for irrigation purposes. In the AQUASTAT database water withdrawal for irrigation is part of agricultural water withdrawal, together with water withdrawal for livestock (watering and cleaning) and water withdrawal for aquaculture. It can include water from renewable freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water. The amount of water withdrawn for irrigation by far exceeds the consumptive use of irrigation because of water lost in its distribution from its source to the crops. The term "water requirement ratio" (sometimes also called "irrigation efficiency") is used to indicate the ratio between the net irrigation water requirements or crop water requirements, which is the volume of water needed to compensate for the deficit between potential evapotranspiration and effective precipitation over the growing period of the crop, and the amount of water withdrawn for irrigation including the losses. In the specific case of paddy rice irrigation, additional water is needed for flooding to facilitate land preparation and for plant protection. In that case, irrigation water requirements are the sum of rainfall deficit and the water needed to flood paddy fields. At scheme level, water requirement ratio values can vary from less than 20 percent to more than 80 percent.

Area waterlogged by irrigation: Part of the land that is waterlogged because of irrigation. Waterlogging is the state of land in which the water table is located at or near the surface resulting in a decline of crop yields. Irrigation can contribute to the raising of the level of the aquifers. The non-saturated area of soils can become too small and the soils are over-saturated with water. If recharge to groundwater is greater than natural drainage, there is a need for additional drainage to avoid waterlogging.
